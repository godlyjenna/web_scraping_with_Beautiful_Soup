Take a LONG but short (under 100 lines of code) walk with me down web scraping lane!
A small project that I did to webscrape a site (url = 'https://web.archive.org/web/20230902185655/https://en.everybodywiki.com/100_Most_Highly-Ranked_Films')
for a particular table (The 100 Most Highly-Ranked Films)
and particular columns (['Average Rank', 'Film', 'Year'])
and data ('Top_50')
in that table. 
After I pull the data from the table I want, I put it into a dataframe (df)
then converted it to a table ('Top_50')
in a database ('Movies.db').


A very beginner friendly project, share your thoughts with me!
